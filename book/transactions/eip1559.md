# EIP-1559 Transactions

EIP-1559 introduced a new transaction type with a more predictable fee model, replacing the legacy gas price auction with a base fee and a priority fee (tip) to incentivize miners.

Key features of EIP-1559 transactions include:
- `max_fee_per_gas`: The absolute maximum you are willing to pay per unit of gas (inclusive of base fee and priority fee).
- `max_priority_fee_per_gas`: The maximum fee you are willing to pay to the miner as a tip.

The `ethers-rs` library provides full support for creating and sending EIP-1559 transactions.

## Example

For a practical demonstration of how to construct and send an EIP-1559 transaction, please refer to the example in the `examples/transactions/examples/eip1559_transaction.rs` file within the repository.

You can typically run this example using:
```bash
cargo run --example eip1559_transaction
```
(Assuming you have a local Ethereum node like Anvil running and configured, or you modify the example to use a public RPC endpoint and a funded wallet.)

This example covers:
- Connecting to an Ethereum node.
- Creating an `Eip1559TransactionRequest`.
- Setting EIP-1559 specific fee parameters.
- Signing and sending the transaction.
- Handling the transaction receipt.
